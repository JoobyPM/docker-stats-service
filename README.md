# Docker Stats Service

A lightweight service that collects real-time Docker container metrics and stores them in InfluxDB. It automatically discovers containers, tracks their resource usage, and provides detailed metrics visualization through Grafana.

## Overview

This service provides real-time Docker container monitoring for development and testing environments. It uses Docker's native stats streaming API to collect metrics continuously and efficiently.

Key benefits:

- Real-time metrics via Docker's native streaming API
- Automatic container discovery and monitoring
- Simple setup for development environments
- Pre-configured Grafana dashboards
